# The proton-bridge project also stores the bridge password in base64 encoded plaintext
# Therefore, this is not worse in terms of security than what proton-bridge currently does
# TODO add a flag for outputting the bridge password from proton-bridge, so the password is
# fully managed by the bridge application
# Avoiding using gpg to encrypt password because currently using curses pinentry program
# curses pinentry program requires a tty
PassCmd "base64 --decode --wrap=0 ~/.config/protonmail/bridge/.proton_bridge_passwd"
# To store the password in an encrypted file use PassCmd instead of Pass
